# Covid 19 Early detection

With the continuous increase in the number of Covid-19 positive patients and suspects, it is becoming difficult for the clinicians to detect patients after taking their clinical tests. In case of Covid-19 detection, the chest X-rays are taken and based on the difference in patches , the detection of COVID-19 is done. It takes around 2 days to find out the person who is positive or not from a pile of Chest X-rays.

Here, we have come up with a solution to this problem. We are preparing a Web Application using which the early detection of Covid can be done.
The dataset has been taken from [here ](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)  , it contains chest X-rays of various patients. The model has been trained using tensorflow
